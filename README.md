# Jupyter Notebooks for the  HPC‚ÄêED Metadata Project 

## Project website: https://github.com/HPC-ED/HPC-ED.github.io/wiki

## Project Description:
The HPC-ED  project team is building a platform for the community to better share and find training materials through a federated repository. This project was started when a group of HPC community members got together to discuss how difficult it was to find and share training materials.

To improve the sharing and discovery of CyberTraining materials, the HPC-ED Pilot project team is building a platform for the community to better share and find training materials through a federated catalog. The platform, currently in early test mode, is focused on a flexible platform, informative metadata, and community participation. By creating a framework for identifying, sharing, and including content broadly, HPC-ED will: allow providers of training materials to reach new groups of learners; extend the breadth and depth of training materials; and enable local sites to add or extend local portals.

## About these Notebooks
The notebooks in this collection are designed to demonstrate how to use the HPC-ED tools to search and ingest data from the HPC-ED repository. The current set of notebooks include:
