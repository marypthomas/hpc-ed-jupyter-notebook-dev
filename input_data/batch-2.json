While GUIs are becoming more prevalent, being able to work at the command line interface (CLI) provides the greatest power and flexibility. In this session, we assume that participants are already comfortable with basic Linux operations such as creating, deleting and renaming files, and navigating between directories. Topics covered include the filesystem hierarchy, file permissions, symbolic and hard links, wildcards and file globbing, finding commands and files, environment variables and modules, configuration files, aliases, history and tips for effective Bash shell scripting.",

In this webinar we cover supercomputer architectures, the differences between threads and processes, implementations of parallelism (e.g., OpenMP and MPI), strong and weak scaling, limitations on scalability (Amdahl\u2019s and Gustafson\u2019s Laws) and benchmarking. We also discuss how to choose the appropriate number of compute cores or nodes when running your applications and, when appropriate, the best balance between threads and processes. This webinar does not assume any programming experience and is suited for a wide audience, including current and prospective users of parallel computers, anyone who expects to write a proposal for computer time or those who are simply curious about parallel computing.",
