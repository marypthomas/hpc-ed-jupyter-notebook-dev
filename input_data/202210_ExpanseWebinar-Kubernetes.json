            "Abstract": "In this webinar we provide recipes for transitioning scientific workloads that currently run on traditional batch systems to Kubernetes systems. Kubernetes is batch-like in nature, but there are some differences that science users should be aware of. We will also briefly describe capabilities that are not found in traditional batch systems that can improve the effectiveness of scientific computing.",
